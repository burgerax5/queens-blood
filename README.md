## Setup

---

1. Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed
2. To setup and run the backend & frontend servers use the Docker command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

3. To automatically detect when changes are made, open up another terminal and enter:

```bash
docker-compose watch
```

Although this is more of an optional step.

<b>NOTE:</b> Saved changes in the backend will NOT be reflected automatically. You will need to restart the backend server.
